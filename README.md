In the project, I have categorized the queries I worked on into different difficulty levels:

Easy:
1. Retrieve the employee with the highest level.
2. Get the count of invoices for each billing country, ordered by the count.
3. Fetch the top 3 invoices with the highest total.
4. Calculate the total invoice amount for each billing city, ordered by the invoice total.
5. Find the customer who has spent the most money in total, including their name and customer ID.

Moderate:
1. Retrieve the email, first name, and last name of customers who have purchased rock genre tracks.
2. Find the top 10 artists with the most songs in the rock genre, including their artist ID and name.
3. Retrieve the names and durations of tracks that have a duration longer than the average track length.

Advanced:
1. Determine the best-selling artist based on total sales generated from their tracks.
2. Identify the most popular genre in each country, including the genre name, country, and the number of purchases, using row number ranking.
3. Retrieve customer details (ID, first name, last name), along with the best-selling artist they have purchased from and the total amount spent by the customer.

These queries provide insights into various aspects of the music store data and demonstrate different levels of complexity in data analysis.
